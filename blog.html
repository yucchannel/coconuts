                <p class="date">November 2024</p>

                    Coconut provides basic commands that make it easy to write programs. Below are the most important commands that you’ll use often:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PRINT</strong> - Outputs text or values to the screen.</li>
                    <li><strong>SET</strong> - Assigns a value to a variable.</li>
                    <li><strong>ADD</strong> - Adds two numbers and stores the result.</li>
                    <li><strong>IF</strong> - Allows conditional logic to control the flow of the program.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Here is a simple example of a Coconut program that adds two numbers:
                </p>
                <pre><code>
SET A TO 5
SET B TO 3
SET RESULT TO ADD A AND B
PRINT RESULT
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    This program sets variables <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> to 5 and 3, then adds them together and prints the result (8).
                </p>

                <h2>Control Structures</h2>
                <p class="date">November 2024</p>
                <p class="author">By: <strong>Yuto Yamamoto</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Coconut supports control structures like loops and conditionals that help you control the flow of your program. The most common ones are <strong>IF</strong>, <strong>ELSE</strong>, and <strong>WHILE</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example of an <strong>IF</strong> statement:
                </p>
                <pre><code>
SET A TO 5
IF A IS GREATER THAN 3 THEN
    PRINT "A is greater than 3"
ELSE
    PRINT "A is not greater than 3"
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    In this example, the program checks if <code>A</code> is greater than 3. If true, it prints the first message; otherwise, it prints the second message.
                </p>

                <h2>Advanced Features</h2>
                <p class="date">December 2024</p>
                <p class="author">By: <strong>Yuto Yamamoto</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Coconut is continuing to evolve, and in future updates, we plan to add features such as functions, arrays, and object-oriented programming (OOP). These additions will allow developers to create more complex applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, we encourage you to explore the basics and experiment with small projects. Stay tuned for future updates!
