                    Creating a programming language has been a dream for many developers, and for us at WCode, it’s finally becoming a reality. Introducing <strong>Coconut Ver1.0</strong>, our entry-level interpreted language designed to make programming simple and fun. This version includes fundamental commands like <code>PRINT</code>, <code>SET</code>, and <code>ADD</code>. It’s a great way to explore basic programming logic and concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Python to build the interpreter, leveraging its simplicity and readability. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning tool for beginners, while also laying the groundwork for advanced features in the future.

                <h2>Accelerating the Language with Ver1.0FASTer</h2>
                <p class="date">November 2024</p>
                <p class="author">By: <strong>Yuto Yamamoto</strong></p>
                <p>
                    After the successful launch of Coconut Ver1.0, we realized the need for speed. Enter <strong>Coconut Ver1.0FASTer</strong> — an upgraded version with multithreaded capabilities to enhance execution speed by up to 2.5 times. Using Python’s <code>concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor</code>, we added parallel processing for operations like printing and intensive computations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenge? Ensuring thread safety while maintaining backward compatibility. The result is a robust interpreter that’s not only faster but also ready for more complex use cases.

                <h2>Introducing Coconut Ver 3.0: The Next Leap Forward</h2>
                <p class="date">December 2024</p>
                <p class="author">By: <strong>Yuto Yamamoto</strong></p>
                <p>
                    With the success of Coconut Ver 1.0 and the optimization of Ver1.0FASTer, we’re proud to announce the arrival of <strong>Coconut Ver 3.0</strong>. This new version introduces powerful features, including error handling, user-defined functions, and an enhanced standard library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest improvement in Ver 3.0 is the introduction of <strong>exception handling</strong>. Now, developers can catch and manage errors using the <code>TRY</code>, <code>EXCEPT</code>, and <code>FINALLY</code> keywords, making Coconut more robust and flexible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we’ve added support for <strong>user-defined functions</strong> allowing users to modularize their code. This is a game changer for those looking to create larger, more complex programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the enhanced standard library now includes utilities for file handling, string manipulation, and more. These updates provide developers with the tools they need to create fully-fledged applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coconut Ver 3.0 is not only about adding features, but also about making the language more powerful and user-friendly. We are excited to see how the community uses these new capabilities to build amazing projects.
