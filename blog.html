                <p class="date">November 2024</p>

                    Creating a programming language has been a dream for many developers, and for us at WCode, it’s finally becoming a reality. Introducing <strong>Coconut Ver1.0</strong>, our entry-level interpreted language designed to make programming simple and fun. This version includes fundamental commands like <code>PRINT</code>, <code>SET</code>, and <code>ADD</code>. It’s a great way to explore basic programming logic and concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used Python to build the interpreter, leveraging its simplicity and readability. The goal is to provide a hands-on learning tool for beginners, while also laying the groundwork for advanced features in the future.

                <h2>Accelerating the Language with Ver1.0FASTer</h2>
                <p class="date">November 2024</p>

                <p>
                    After the successful launch of Coconut Ver1.0, we realized the need for speed. Enter <strong>Coconut Ver1.0FASTer</strong> — an upgraded version with multithreaded capabilities to enhance execution speed by up to 2.5 times. Using Python’s <code>concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor</code>, we added parallel processing for operations like printing and intensive computations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenge? Ensuring thread safety while maintaining backward compatibility. The result is a robust interpreter that’s not only faster but also ready for more complex use cases.

                <p>Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to evolve the Coconut language!</p>

                    We are constantly working on improving Coconut. The next major milestone will be the addition of object-oriented programming (OOP) support. This will allow developers to create more structured and maintainable code. We are also exploring better error handling, improved debugging features, and a more advanced runtime environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our vision for Coconut is to evolve into a language that supports both beginner-friendly projects and professional, large-scale applications. As always, the development is driven by community feedback, so feel free to reach out with your thoughts and ideas!
