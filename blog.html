                    Creating a programming language has been a dream for many developers, and for us at WCode, it’s finally becoming a reality. Introducing <strong>Coconut Ver1.0</strong>, our entry-level interpreted language designed to make programming simple and fun. This version includes fundamental commands like <code>PRINT</code>, <code>SET</code>, and <code>ADD</code>. It’s a great way to explore basic programming logic and concepts.
